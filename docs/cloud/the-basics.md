Prefect Server and Prefect Cloud are two ready-to-use state database and UI backends. They already work perfectly with any of your Prefect flows to orchestrate and inspect your Prefect flow runs.

Prefect Server is an open source, lightweight version of our highly-available, production-ready backend product Prefect Cloud. 

# Prefect Server
Prefect Server is an open-source backend automatically extends the Prefect Core engine with: 

- a full GraphQL API
- a complete UI for flows and jobs
- remote execution clusters
- automatic and asynchronous scheduling
- projects for flow organization

# Prefect Cloud

Prefect Cloud is a fully hosted, production-ready backend for Prefect Core. If you've used Prefect Server, Prefect Cloud is a drop in replacement that provides some enhanced features, including:

- permissions and authorization
- secure runtime secrets and parameters
- cloud hooks
- many more features...

If you are new to Prefect, we recommend learning more about [Prefect](https://www.prefect.io) and our open source engine, [Prefect Core](https://docs.prefect.io/core/) in the Prefect Core section of the docs.

To start running your first flow, we suggest following the Flow Run Tutorial in the [UI](https://cloud.prefect.io). (You'll find tutorials in the Side Menu that you can access by clicking the menu button on the top left corner of the dashboard.) Then follow the instructions and the examples in [Up And Running](https://docs.prefect.io/cloud/upandrunning.html) and [Deploying A Flow](https://docs.prefect.io/cloud/flow-deploy.html) to start running your own flows.
