# Multi Flow Storage

This recipe is for storing multiple Flows inside a single [Docker storage](api/unreleased/environments/storage.html#docker). This is useful when users have a suite of Flows that they may deploy off of some CI/CD process or they simply want to reduce the amount of images stored in their container registry. For this recipe we are going to put two example Flowsâ€”[ETL](/core/examples/etl.html) and [Map Reduce](/core/examples/map_reduce.html)â€”inside of the same Docker storage.

### Flow(s) Source

```python
from prefect import task, Flow

# ETL Flow

@task
def extract():
    return [1, 2, 3]


@task
def transform(data):
    return [i * 10 for i in data]


@task
def load(data):
    print("Here's your data: {}".format(data))


with Flow("ETL") as etl_flow:
    e = extract()
    t = transform(e)
    l = load(t)

# Map Reduce Flow

@task
def numbers_task():
    return [1, 2, 3]


@task
def map_task(x):
    return x + 1


@task
def reduce_task(x):
    return sum(x)


with Flow("Map / Reduce ðŸ¤“") as mr_flow:
    numbers = numbers_task()
    first_map = map_task.map(numbers)
    second_map = map_task.map(first_map)
    reduction = reduce_task(second_map)
```

### Adding Flows to Storage

In this code block we manually add our two Flows to the same Docker storage object. Then the storage is built a single time and that new Docker storage is assigned to both Flows. When the Flows are deployed to Prefect Cloud `build=False` so the storage is not built again.

```python
from prefect.environments.storage import Docker

# Create our Docker storage
storage = Docker(registry_url="gcr.io/dev/", image_name="multi_flows", image_tag="0.1.0")

# Add both Flows to storage
storage.add_flow(etl_flow)
storage.add_flow(mr_flow)

# Build the storage
storage = storage.build()

# Reassign the new storage object to each Flow
etl_flow.storage = storage
mr_flow.storage = storage

# Deploy each flow without building a second time
etl_flow.deploy(project_name="...", build=False)
mr_flow.deploy(project_name="...", build=False)
```
