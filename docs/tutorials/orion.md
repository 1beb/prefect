# The components of Orion 

Orion is a collection of services that form a dedicated _orchestration environment_:

- the **database** is the persistent metadata store that holds flow and task run history, along with references to data produced by tasks and flows
- the **webserver** is a REST API backed by [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) that receives information emitted from workflows and additionally responds with orchestration instructions
- the **agent** is a small polling process responsible for submitting _flow_ runs (currently as local subprocesses)
- lastly, the **UI** is the flexible control plane for monitoring, configuring and analyzing Prefect workflows

## The webserver

The Orion webserver can be stood up with a single CLI command:

<div class="termy">
```
$ prefect orion start
Starting Orion API...
INFO:     Started server process [84081]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:5000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```
</div>

There are numerous ways to begin exploring the API that is now at your fingertips:

- navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000/docs (or your corresponding API URL) to see the autogenerated Swagger API documentation
- navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000/redoc (or your corresponding API URL) to see the autogenerated Redoc API documentation
- instantiate an asynchronous `OrionClient` within Python to send requests to the API

During normal operation is it not expected that you will need to interact with the API directly, as this is handled automatically for you within the Python client and the UI.
