# First Steps

Prfect works via API but that doesn't mean we can't run interactively.  Before standing up a full webserver, let's explore the Python building blocks.

<div class="termy">
```
$ uvicorn main:app --reload

<span style="color: green;">INFO</span>:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
<span style="color: green;">INFO</span>:     Started reloader process [28720]
<span style="color: green;">INFO</span>:     Started server process [28722]
<span style="color: green;">INFO</span>:     Waiting for application startup.
<span style="color: green;">INFO</span>:     Application startup complete.
```
</div>
