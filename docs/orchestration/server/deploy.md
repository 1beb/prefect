# Deploying Prefect Server

Prefect Server is designed to be deployed inside user infrastructure, and should be runnable in a wide
variety of deployment backends. Currently the core team only officially supports a single-node
deployment, but there are plans to expand to other deployment models (e.g. Kubernetes) in the near future. If you're
interested in supporting such efforts, please [feel free to reach out](TODO-link-here).
