# Cloud Hooks <Badge text="Cloud"/>

Cloud Hooks allow you to send notifications to certain endpoints, such as Slack, Twilio, Pager Duty and email, when your flow enters a given state. For example, you can send a Slack message to your team when a production-critical flow has failed, along with the reason for the failure, so you can respond immediately.

You can set up and edit your Cloud Hooks using the Interactive API or the Flow Settings page in the UI.
