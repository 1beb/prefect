# Team Settings <Badge text="Cloud"/>

Teams in Cloud allow you to share your work among users. You can assign [a role](../concepts/roles.html) to each member of your team.  Each team member will also have their own (free) account.  

## Switching Teams

To switch teams, head to the side-bar and click on your current team.  You will see all the teams you are part of as well as any outstanding invitations to join a new team.
