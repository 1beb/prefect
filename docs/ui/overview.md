# Orion UI Overview

The Prefect Orion UI provides an overview of all of your flows. It was designed around a simple question: what's the health of my system?

The UI displays many useful insights about your flow runs, including:

- Flow run summaries
- Deployed flow details
- Scheduled flow runs
- Warnings for late or failed runs
- Task run details 
- Radar flow and task dependency visualizer 
- Logs

You can filter the information displayed in the UI by time, flow status, and tags.

When Prefect Server is running, you can access the UI at [http://127.0.0.1:4200](http://127.0.0.1:4200).
