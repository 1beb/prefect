# Prefect Cloud

Prefect Cloud is a hosted UI for your flows and deployments. Prefect Cloud provides all the capabilities of the [Orion UI](/ui/overview/), plus additional features available only for Cloud accounts. This includes:

- Flow run summaries
- Deployed flow details
- Scheduled flow runs
- Warnings for late or failed runs
- Task run details 
- Radar flow and task dependency visualizer 
- Logs

Features only available on Prefect Cloud include:

- User accounts
- Workspaces

## Sign in or register

To sign in with an existing account or register an account, go to [http://api-beta.prefect.io/](http://api-beta.prefect.io/).

You can create an account with:

- Google account
- GitHub account
- Email and password

## Create a workspace

If you register a new account, you'll be prompted to create a new workspace. Workspaces enable you to organize work, keeping workflows for different projects, teams, or clients in their own spaces.

Click **Edit Workspace**. This lets you edit details about the workspace or delete the workspace. 

It also provide the Prefect CLI command that configures Prefect to orchestrate flow runs with this workspace. Copy this command and run it in the environment in which you'll be running flows so they'll show up in your workspace.
