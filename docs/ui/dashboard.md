# Dashboard

The dashboard provides high-level visibility into the status and health of your flow and task runs. From the dashboard you can filter results to explore specific run status, scheduled runs, and more, and you can drill down into details about: 

- Deployments
- Flow runs
- Task runs
- Logs

When Prefect Server is running, you can access the UI at [http://127.0.0.1:4200](http://127.0.0.1:4200). If you're running a local server or accessing a server running in a container or cluster, the default initial view is the dashboard.
