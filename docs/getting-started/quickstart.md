# Quickstart

Prefect is an orchestration and observability platform that empowers developers to build and scale resilient code quickly, turning their scheduled jobs into resilient, recurring workflows.

In this quickstart, you'll see how you can schedule your code, visualize workflows, and monitor your entire system health with Prefect.

With Prefect, you can go from Python script to production-ready workflow in minutes.

Let's get started!

## Setup

Say you have some Python code that runs locally.
The script below fetches statistics about the [main Prefect GitHub repository](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect).

```python
import httpx

def get_repo_info():
    url = "https://api.github.com/repos/PrefectHQ/prefect"
    response = httpx.get(url)
    repo = response.json()
    print("PrefectHQ/prefect repository statistics ðŸ¤“:")
    print(f"Stars ðŸŒ  : {repo['stargazers_count']}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    get_repo_info()
```

How can you make this script schedulable, observable, resilient, and capable of running anywhere?

## Step 1: Install Prefect

```bash
pip install -U "prefect"
```

If needed, see the [install guide](/getting-started/installation/) for more detailed installation instructions.

## Step 2: Connect to Prefect's API

Much of Prefect's functionality is backed by an API.
Sign up for a forever free [Prefect Cloud account](/cloud/) or accept your organization's invite to join their account.

1. Sign in with an existing account or create a new account at [https://app.prefect.cloud/](https://app.prefect.cloud/).
1. Use the `prefect cloud login` CLI command to [log into Prefect Cloud](/cloud/users/api-keys) from your environment.

<div class="terminal">

```bash
prefect cloud login
```

</div>

Choose **Log in with a web browser** and click **Authorize** button in the browser window that opens.

## Step 3: Turn your function into a Prefect flow

The fastest way to get started with Prefect is to add a `@flow` decorator to any Python function.
[Flows](/concepts/flows/) are the core observable, deployable units in Prefect and are the primary entrypoint to orchestrated work.

```python hl_lines="2 5" title="my_workflow.py"
import httpx
from prefect import flow


@flow(log_print=True)
def get_repo_info():
    url = "https://api.github.com/repos/PrefectHQ/prefect"
    response = httpx.get(url)
    repo = response.json()
    print("PrefectHQ/prefect repository statistics ðŸ¤“:")
    print(f"Stars ðŸŒ  : {repo['stargazers_count']}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    repo_info()
```

<div class="terminal">

```bash
python my_flow.py
```

</div>

When we run this script, Prefect will automatically track the state of the flow run and log the output where we can see it in the UI.

## Step 4: Choose a remote infrastructure location for your flow

Because we're using Prefect Cloud we have access to a hosted infrastructure for running our flows.
A work pool specifies the type of infrastructure and provides presets for workflows.
Let's create a Prefect Managed work pool so that Prefect can run our flows for us.

We can create a work pool in the UI or from the CLI.

<div class="terminal">

```bash
prefect work-pool create my-managed-pool --type prefect:managed
```

</div>

## Step 4: Make your code schedulable

We have a flow function and we have a work pool where we can use to run our flow remotely.
Let's package both of these things, along with the location of the flow code to pull at runtime, into a [deployment](/concepts/deployments/) so that we can schedule and trigger runs of our flow remotely.

Deployments elevate flows to remotely configurable entities that have their own API.

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    repo_info()
```

You should see a link directing you to the deployment page that you can use to begin interacting with your newly created deployment!

For example, you can trigger a run of this deployment by either clicking the "Run" button in the top right of the deployment page in the UI, or by running the following CLI command in your terminal:

<div class="terminal">

```bash
prefect deployment run 'Repo Info/my-first-deployment'  
```

</div>

This command creates a new run for this deployment that is then picked up by the process running `repo_info.serve`.

![Flow run timeline](/img/ui/flow-run-diagram.png)

You should see logs from the flow run in the CLI and the UI that look similar to this:

<div class="terminal">

```bash
09:44:37.947 | INFO    | Flow run 'piquant-sawfly' - Downloading flow code from storage at '/my_path'
09:44:39.385 | INFO    | Flow run 'piquant-sawfly' - Stars ðŸŒ  : 12736
09:44:40.527 | INFO    | Flow run 'piquant-sawfly' - Finished in state Completed('All states completed.')
09:44:43.018 | INFO    | prefect.flow_runs.runner - Process 9867 exited cleanly.
```

</div>

!!! tip "Getting started tips"
    - You can call your flow function directly like any other Python function and its execution will be registered and monitored with the Prefect API and visible in the UI
    - Elevating a flow to a [deployment](/concepts/deployments/) exposes a Prefect-backed API for remotely managing and configuring your workflow with things such as [scheduling rules](/concepts/schedules/), [trigger rules](/cloud/automations/), and cancellation
    - Deployments require that flow functions are defined in static files, and therefore calling the `serve` method on an interactively defined flow will raise an error

## Step 5: Add a schedule

We can add a [schedule](/concepts/schedules/) to our deployment.  We could do this in one of two ways:

- use the Prefect UI to create and attach the schedule
- specify the schedule in code

It's generally best practice to keep your configuration defined within code, so let's update the script above to specify a schedule:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # create your first scheduled deployment
    repo_info.serve(name="my-first-deployment", cron="0 0 * * *")
```

Once run, this will create a cron schedule for our deployment that instructs it to run at noon every day. When you stop this script, Prefect will automatically pause your deployment's schedule for you.
