# Events


Events are the primary unit of observability in Prefect Cloud, and represent something happening in your data stack at a point in time. Events are designed to be to be a simple but complete record of something happening somewhere in your stack, enabling both analysis of the data stack and the configuration of reactivity via triggers and actions.
