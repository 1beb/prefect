# Prefect

## Welcome to Prefect!

Prefect is a workflow management system designed for modern data infrastructures.

Users organize `tasks` into `flows`, and Prefect takes care of the rest!


### "...Prefect?"

From the Latin *praefectus*, meaning "one who is in charge", a prefect is an official who oversees a domain and ensures that the rules are followed.

It also happens to be the name of a roving researcher for that wholly remarkable book, *The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy*.


## Requirements

Prefect requires Python 3.4+.

## Documentation

To build and view documentation (wait a moment for the initial build to finish):
```bash
yarn docs:dev & open "http://localhost:8080"
```
